# AI-generated-system
AI generated system. We are not going to write the code or draw. Only chatting with AI =)

## Functional requirements

The system should be able to manage users who wants pay their bills or give ability to pay without registartion

The mayment should be sent to a service provider via available payment system (such as easy pay, paypal, etc)

System should take care about payment process (make retries if needed, notify if payment provider is unavailable) and continue process if it was failed in the middle (be relyable)

For registred users sustesm should save a history of payments

System should have web UI, backend service/services and relation database

please suggest the architecture. Draw the container C4 diagram using mermaid

## Design proposal

// C4 Level 2: Container Diagram
```mermaid
  diagram
  title Container Diagram

  // Containers
  container WebUI as "Web UI"
  container BackendService as "Payment Service"
  container Database as "Payment Database"
  container PaymentProvider as "Payment Provider"

  // Relationships
  User --> WebUI : Uses
  WebUI --> BackendService : Sends payment requests
  BackendService --> Database : Stores payment history
  BackendService --> PaymentProvider : Processes payments
